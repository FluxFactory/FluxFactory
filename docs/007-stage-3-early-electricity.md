# Stage 3: Early Electricity (LV) - WIP

### Goal
The primary objective of this stage is to transition from steam to electrical power generation, introducing new essential resources like sulfur and redstone.

### Key Activities
Players will focus on:
-   Creating a large bronze boiler to generate RF power.
-   Obtaining first sulfur and redstone.
-   Utilizing the MegaCorp teleporter for Nether access to acquire sulfur.

### New Capabilities Unlocked
-   RF (Redstone Flux) power generation and utilization.
-   Access to new essential resources: sulfur and redstone.
-   Early low-voltage (LV) electrical automation.

### Gameplay Focus
This stage emphasizes:
-   The transition from steam-based to electrical power systems.
-   Resource diversification, particularly acquiring sulfur from the Nether.
-   Expanding automation capabilities with early electrical machines.

### Key Machines and Structures
-   **Large Bronze Boiler (RF Generator):** A significant multi-block structure that converts steam into RF (Redstone Flux) power, marking the player's entry into electrical automation.
-   **MegaCorp Teleporter (Nether Access):** A pre-provided high-tier teleporter that grants access to the Nether dimension, primarily for acquiring sulfur.
-   **Early LV Machines:** Initial low-voltage electrical machines that utilize RF power for more advanced automation.
