#### Main Concept

This technical modpack draws inspiration from `GregTech: New Horizons` but centers on **Redstone Flux (RF)** as the primary energy source, without including the `GregTech` mod itself. The gameplay features a distinct tier system, requiring players to complete "corporate orders" by supplying specific resources to advance to the next stage.

#### Key Goals and Mechanics

* **GregTech Spirit, No GregTech Mod:** The progression is designed to be complex and well-thought-out, demanding strategic planning and automation.
* **RF as Primary Energy:** Redstone Flux is the main energy type, replacing `EU`. The modpack will integrate additional mods or scripts to introduce complexity to energy transfer, such as losses and wire explosions.
* **Tier System:** Gameplay is structured into distinct voltage tiers, which dictate accessible technologies:
    * LV (Low Voltage)
    * MV (Medium Voltage)
    * HV (High Voltage)
    * EV (Extreme Voltage)
    * And higher tiers
* **"Corporation" Quest System:**
    * Players assume the role of an employee of the `MineCorp` corporation.
    * Advancing between tiers involves completing tasks from a quest book, which typically requires sending specified resources (e.g., 128 steel ingots) to a "base".
    * This system establishes clear objectives for each phase of the game.
* **Research System:**
    * Recipes are not immediately available; they must be "researched" through a mechanic similar to `Thaumcraft`.
    * Players create a "Blueprint," invest resources, and then the technology (e.g., a diesel generator) becomes craftable.
* **Minimizing Repetitive Grinding:** Repetitive actions, such as upgrading the same mechanism, are to be limited (to no more than 3-4 times). Instead, progress should unlock entirely new gameplay paths.
* **Space Race:** Later tiers of the game are heavily focused on space exploration, including the Moon, Mars, and other planets, each offering unique resources and challenges.

### Tier Progression Plan

1.  **LV-tier (Initial Stage)**
    * **Goal:** Survive, establish basic resource gathering, and generate the first electricity.
    * **Gameplay:** This stage is semi-vanilla, involving building the initial base and crafting the first RF-generators and simple machines (e.g., `Thermal` series).
    * **Transition:** To progress, players must collect and deliver the first batch of processed metals to the corporation.

2.  **MV-tier (Medium Stage)**
    * **Goal:** Develop more intricate production chains and construct the first multiblock structure.
    * **Gameplay:** This tier unlocks new, more efficient machines and introduces a crucial new metal essential for progression. Access to the Nether also becomes available.
    * **Key Structure:** The first multiblock mechanism, such as a large blast furnace.
    * **Transition:** Progress is achieved by sending a batch of products created using multiblocks.

3.  **HV-tier (High-Tech Stage)**
    * **Goal:** Automate the base and prepare for space travel.
    * **Gameplay:** Players gain access to `Applied Energistics` for creating an ME network and extensive automation. Components for a rocket are also built during this stage.
    * **Transition:** To advance, players must build and successfully launch a rocket.

4.  **EV-tier and higher (Space Stage)**
    * **Goal:** Establish presence on the Moon and other planets.
    * **Gameplay:**
        * **Moon:** Features new unique resources not found on Earth, along with new dangers, and requires building a lunar base.
        * **Other planets (Mars, etc.):** Each planet presents distinct challenges, resources, and technological pathways.
    * **Transition:** Progression becomes more open-ended, with the primary focus on exploring new worlds to acquire resources for "end-game" technologies.

#### Summary

The ultimate aim is to develop a modpack that incorporates the best elements of hardcore builds, such as complexity and multi-stage progression, while making the gameplay more dynamic and diverse. This is achieved through a quest system, unique research mechanics, and a clear division into tiers, where each subsequent stage feels like a fresh gaming experience.
