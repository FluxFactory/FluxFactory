Players will focus on:
- **Brand New Home:** Building a simple shelter to protect against environmental threats.
- **Securing Food:** Setting up a reliable food source, such as a basic farm, to ensure survival.
- **Crafting Essential Tools:** Utilizing a mod (since Tinker's Construct is not available for 1.21.1) to create fundamental tools for gathering resources.
- **Resource Acquisition:** Locating and mining essential base ores like copper, tin, and iron.
- **Tool Advancement:** Upgrading tools to iron quality for improved efficiency and durability.
- **Early Steel Production:** Initiating steel production using a brick-based blast furnace.

### New Capabilities Unlocked
- **Basic Tool Crafting:** Access to a mod-based system for creating initial tools.
- **Kiln System:** Introduction to the multi-block kiln for efficient bronze and basic alloy production, powered by coal, which includes integrated casting capabilities for forming liquid metals into tool parts (e.g., pickaxe heads, axe heads, tool rods).
- **Bronze Production:** The ability to combine copper and tin to create bronze, potentially through manual dust mixing and smelting, or more efficiently via the kiln system.
- **Brick Blast Furnace:** Construction and operation of a brick-based blast furnace for steel production.

### Gameplay Focus
This stage emphasizes:
- **Early Survival:** Adapting to the environment and securing basic needs.
- **Resource Management:** Efficiently gathering and utilizing raw materials.
- **Technological Progression:** Advancing from primitive tools to more durable iron, and ultimately, the creation of bronze and early steel.
- **Introduction to Metallurgy:** Learning the basics of ore processing and alloy creation, with a focus on efficient alloy production using the multi-block kiln system (including casting) and the brick blast furnace for steel.

### Key Machines and Structures
-   **Kiln System:** A multi-block structure powered by coal, essential for efficient bronze and basic alloy production. It includes integrated casting capabilities for forming liquid metals into tool parts (e.g., pickaxe heads, axe heads, tool rods).
-   **Brick Blast Furnace:** A multi-block furnace used for early steel production. Players will need to construct and operate this to create steel, which is vital for later stages.

## Stage 2: Steam Age

### Goal
The primary objective of the Steam Age is to establish a robust steam power infrastructure, enabling more advanced automation and setting the foundation for the transition to electricity.

### Key Activities
Players will focus on:
-   **Steam Generation:** Constructing and operating steam boilers to produce steam.
-   **Fluid Management:** Setting up pipe networks for water and steam transport.
-   **Steam-Powered Automation:** Building and utilizing machines that run on steam power for various processing tasks.
-   **Resource Optimization:** Learning to efficiently manage fuel and water for steam production.
-   **Preparing for Electricity:** Researching and gathering resources for large-scale steam boilers capable of generating electricity.

### New Capabilities Unlocked
-   **Steam Power:** Access to steam as a primary energy source for machines.
-   **Fluid Transport Systems:** Introduction to pipes, pumps, and other fluid handling mechanics.
-   **Advanced Processing:** New steam-powered machines for more complex crafting and resource refinement.
-   **Recycling:** The ability to recycle bronze steam machines back into bronze, ensuring resource recovery.

### Gameplay Focus
This stage emphasizes:
-   **Industrial Expansion:** Scaling up production through steam-powered automation.
-   **Fluid Mechanics:** Understanding and managing fluid flow, pressure and temperature.
-   **Early Power Grids:** Building interconnected systems for steam distribution.
-   **Transitional Engineering:** Preparing for the shift to electrical power by developing large-scale steam generation.

### Key Machines and Structures
-   **Steam Boilers:** Essential multi-block structures for generating steam from water and fuel.
-   **Fluid Transport Systems:** Networks of pipes and pumps for efficient movement of water and steam.
-   **Steam-Powered Machines:** Various machines (e.g., steam-powered furnaces, presses) that utilize steam for automated processing.
