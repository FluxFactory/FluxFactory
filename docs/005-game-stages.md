### Key Activities
Players will focus on:
- **Brand New Home:** Building a simple shelter to protect against environmental threats.
- **Securing Food:** Setting up a reliable food source, such as a basic farm, to ensure survival.
- **Crafting Essential Tools:** Utilizing a mod (since Tinker's Construct is not available for 1.21.1) to create fundamental tools for gathering resources.
- **Resource Acquisition:** Locating and mining essential base ores like copper, tin, and iron.
- **Tool Advancement:** Upgrading tools to iron quality for improved efficiency and durability.

### New Capabilities Unlocked
- **Basic Tool Crafting:** Access to a mod-based system for creating initial tools.
- **Kiln Operation:** Introduction to the kiln for more efficient bronze and basic alloy production, powered by coal.
- **Bronze Production:** The ability to combine copper and tin to create bronze, potentially through manual dust mixing and smelting, or more efficiently via the kiln.

### Gameplay Focus
This stage emphasizes:
- **Early Survival:** Adapting to the environment and securing basic needs.
- **Resource Management:** Efficiently gathering and utilizing raw materials.
- **Technological Progression:** Advancing from primitive tools to more durable iron, and ultimately, the creation of bronze.
- **Introduction to Metallurgy:** Learning the basics of ore processing and alloy creation, with a focus on efficient alloy production using the kiln.

## Stage 2: Steam Age
