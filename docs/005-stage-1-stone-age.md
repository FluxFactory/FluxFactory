# Stage 1: Stone Age

### Goal
The primary objective of the Stone Age is to produce bronze, which marks a significant technological advancement.

### Key Activities
Players will focus on:
- **Brand New Home:** Building a simple shelter to protect against environmental threats.
- **Securing Food:** Setting up a reliable food source, such as a basic farm, to ensure survival.
- **Crafting Essential Tools:** Utilizing a mod (since Tinker's Construct is not available for 1.21.1) to create fundamental tools for gathering resources.
- **Resource Acquisition:** Locating and mining essential base ores like copper, tin, and iron.
- **Tool Advancement:** Upgrading tools to iron quality for improved efficiency and durability.
- **Early Steel Production:** Initiating steel production using a brick-based blast furnace.

### New Capabilities Unlocked
- **Basic Tool Crafting:** Access to a mod-based system for creating initial tools.
- **Kiln System:** Introduction to the multi-block kiln for efficient bronze and basic alloy production, powered by coal, which includes integrated casting capabilities for forming liquid metals into tool parts (e.g., pickaxe heads, axe heads, tool rods).
- **Bronze Production:** The ability to combine copper and tin to create bronze, potentially through manual dust mixing and smelting, or more efficiently via the kiln system.
- **Brick Blast Furnace:** Construction and operation of a brick-based blast furnace for steel production.

### Gameplay Focus
This stage emphasizes:
- **Early Survival:** Adapting to the environment and securing basic needs.
- **Resource Management:** Efficiently gathering and utilizing raw materials.
- **Technological Progression:** Advancing from primitive tools to more durable iron, and ultimately, the creation of bronze and early steel.
- **Introduction to Metallurgy:** Learning the basics of ore processing and alloy creation, with a focus on efficient alloy production using the multi-block kiln system (including casting) and the brick blast furnace for steel.

### Key Machines and Structures
-   **Kiln System:** A multi-block structure powered by coal, essential for efficient bronze and basic alloy production. It includes integrated casting capabilities for forming liquid metals into tool parts (e.g., pickaxe heads, axe heads, tool rods).
-   **Brick Blast Furnace:** A multi-block furnace used for early steel production. Players will need to construct and operate this to create steel, which is vital for later stages.
